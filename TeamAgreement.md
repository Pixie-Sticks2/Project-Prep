Our plan is to have a daily group Stand-Up meeting to each have the oppourtunity to say "What did I do? What am I going to do? Do I have any obstacles in my way? This meeting ideally will happen at the beginning of our day, where we share code, ideas, and look to eachother for assistance if needed.

# Pixie Sticks Conflict Plan:

Our plan is to attempt to resolve conflict or disagreement one on one, or if it is something that is creating tension, we can feel free to present the obstacle to the group for resolution. This will allow us to handle it whether we prefer direct contact, or if we would like to get more than just two perspectives on the situation. If it comes to it, the group can vote on an issue, and if that doesn't work, we will consult our instructor.

# Pixie Sticks Work Plan:

At any point, a project member can ask the group for a team meeting/code reviewe. We will collaborate on the entire project outline, break down the project into smaller tasks, and agree as a group to split up the tasks for the day/week.

# Git Process:

We plan to push all of our work throughout the day to our organization's repo. We will also set up safeguards, such as the requirement of two members to approve a pull/merge that they DID NOT work on themselves. We will communicate any needs to ACP our work in the event that it is needed for another part of the project to work.
